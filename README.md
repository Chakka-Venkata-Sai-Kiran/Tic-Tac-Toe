# Tic-Tac-Toe
This experiment is an object oriented program that was all put together and implemented 
through a game of Tic Tac Toe. The goal is to illustrate the process of designing an object 
oriented solution to a small problem by simulating Tic Tac Toe ,a two person game that 
lets them mark their choosen cells with their respective characters and whoever marks three 
in a row,wins. Most of us think this game is a luck based game.
